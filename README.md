# Chromothripsis

## Background
Chromothripsis is the shattering and rearrangement of chromosomes in a single catastrophic event. It has been found to be linked to cancer and challenges the previous theories of slow accumulation of mutations leading to cancer

## Experimental Process
### Cell Culturing 

Experiments were carried out on A549 cells (human lung carcinoma) which had to be cultured first.

### CRISPR/Cas9 Edit
Once the cultures had grown enough, I plated them into 6-well plates.

What is TREX1?

> TREX1 is a 3' exonuclease responsible for proofreading DNA polymerase. When TREX1 is deactivated, it results in the fusion of telomeres across chromosomes. When the telomeres break apart, they end up shortened. 


#### Transfecting

After I left the cells to grow, they looked like this 4 days later:

### DNA Extraction  

I extracted the DNA from both the gene edited cells and the regular cells so I could run a series of tests to see if the gene edit actually happened and if chromothripsis occurred.
